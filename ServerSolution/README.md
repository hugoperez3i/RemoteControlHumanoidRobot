# Server Solution

- Under the `/Server/` directory, the code required to build and run the server can be found. 
- The `/Client/` dir contains two git submodules, corresponding to the JavaFX client application, and the UE5 client module.
- On `/TestClient/`, a simple implementation (in Cpp) that showcases all server functionality can be found.
- The dir `/TestMCU/` is a containerized implementation (based on OpenSUSE tumbleweed) of an mcu, allowing for local testing/development without requiring a physical MCU.
